# ArrayShuffler

An algorithm that takes in an array of values and returns a randomly shuffled version of that array.

This can be applied to games or "pick a number from a hat" scenarios (ex. picking raffle tickets or picking draft order in fantasy football).

Here's a practical application of this concept in a web app that I made that picks numbers 0-9 randomly for a game of Super Bowl Squares:  http://mcommend.azurewebsites.net/#!/footballSquares
