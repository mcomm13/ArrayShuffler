# arrayShuffler

An algorithm that takes in an array of values and returns a randomly sorted version of that array.  Basically, it shuffles the array.

This can be applied to games or "pick a number from a hat" scenarios (ex. picking raffle tickets or picking draft order in fantasy football).

Here's a practical application of this concept in a web app that I made that picks numbers random numbers for a game of Super Bowl Squares:  http://mcommend.azurewebsites.net/#!/footballSquares
